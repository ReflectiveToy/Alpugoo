<h2>Independent Agencies</h2>
<p class="info">All of the agencies that I just talked about were part of the Executive Branch. What about the ones that arenâ€™t? Well there are some agencies that do not directly report to any of the 3 branches. Some popular ones are agencies such as NASA, the CIA, the Environmental Protection Agency,  the USPS (US Postal Service), and the Small Business Administration.</p>
